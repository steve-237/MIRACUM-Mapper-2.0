# MIRACUM-Mapper-2.0

## Project Description

In this project, our main focus is on creating a dynamic and user-friendly mapping interface powered by ASP.NET Core MVC and C#. The core aim is to simplify the intricate task of mapping real-world data to medical terminologies, classifications, and nomenclatures. By leveraging the flexibility of ASP.NET Core MVC, we aspire to empower users to seamlessly navigate and map diverse datasets encountered in the medical domain. The overarching goal is to tackle the pressing issues of interoperability and data harmonization within the healthcare sector. This involves providing a structured and adaptable solution that not only enhances the consistency and coherence of medical data representation but also promotes seamless integration and exchange of information across different systems and sources. The interface is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users, regardless of their familiarity with medical terminologies, can efficiently contribute to the mapping process. With ASP.NET Core MVC at its core, the application embodies a robust framework for achieving these objectives, making strides towards a more interconnected and harmonized landscape in medical data management.
